                <p>At the heart of the product network is the product itself. The Product, in a software company, literally consists of code deployed to an environment where people can access it.  All products are connected to three things: developers, users, and a business.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Developers(engineers): are the people who can write and deploy code. Companies usually have people working on the product that arenâ€™t programming, but the people updating the code are the only folks on the team who are strictly necessary. Developers can perform all company duties.</li>
                    <li>Users(customers):are the people who either use the product or might use the product. All products have the goal of being used, on some level, by people.</li>
                    <li>Business:the entity that funds and hopes to benefit (e.g. profit) from the product. Whether the organization is for-profit or non-profit, there is a bank with a finite amount of funds.</li>
